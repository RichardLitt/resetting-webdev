# What is Wabi-Sabi?

Which brings us to Wabi-Sabi.

Like most religious/cultural experiences that aren't defined by what's explicitly written in a book, Wabi-Sabi is hard to pin down.

Wabi-Sabi finds its roots in 12th-century Japan, with Zen Buddhism's rather-peaceful march across eastern Asia. In 1191 Eisai, a Japanese buddhist monk, returned to Japan after journeying through China, bringing with him the principles of Chan, named Zen, Buddhism, bringing tea into Japanese buddhist practice. Over the next two centuries, the tea ceremony evolved into an elaborate ceremony for the wealthy classes of Japan to show off their fortune.

In the 15th century, a series of tea masters started experimenting with new forms of the tea ceremony. Murata Jukō started using plain, simple, local utensils in ceremonies. His successor Takeno Jōō took things further and started formulating what would become known as Wabi-cha. Wabi-cha evolved as an appreciation of local wares and small spaces.

Sen Rikyū - Takeno Jōō's disciple - simplified the process even more, emphasizing an aesthetic of forlorn-ness (wabi).

> Only for flowers

> And with it, spring.

- Fujiwara Ietaka (1158–1237)

Rikyū set up specific principles for his tea ceremonies stripping away all extravagance which had regularly been a part of the Way of Tea. Tea rooms were reduced in size so that there was just enough space for guests and the host to sit on the floor. Tea huts were based on farmer huts, and bowls were simple earthen wares which had been affected by time (sabi). His ceremony endures today.

In the context of the Way of Tea, tea is an embodiment of simple interestingness. It encompasses poetry, art, literature, and history. It is an antidote to the chaos and extravagance that was 10th-16th century Japan. Rikyū's perusal of wabi-cha was a critique of the community that espoused lavishness and luxury.

He pushed for a simpler, stripped-down mentality that appreciated simplicity and natural processes.

Wabi-Sabi is the idea that there's beauty in the interesting things, that time is will eventually wear anything down, and an appreciation of non-perfection. It is the physical representation of Zen Buddhism - we're surrounded by real, constantly changing, constantly breaking natural objects. Nature comes into our lives and Wabi-Sabi is acceptance of this.

Nothingness, destruction, cosmic order, non-perfection, irregularities, being understated and simpleness are core tenets.

While it is beyond definition, rather a mindset than rules, a few high-level concepts broadly split up in metaphysical and material can be drawn out.

## The Metaphysical

1. Things are devolving toward, or evolving from nothingness.
2. Truth comes from the observation of nature
    * All things are impermanent
    * All things are imperfect
    * All things are incomplete
3. Greatness exists in the inconspicuous and overlooked details
4. Beauty can be coaxed out of ugliness
5. Acceptance of the inevitable
6. Appreciation of the cosmic order
7. Get rid of all that is unnecessary.
8. Focus on the intrinsic and ignore the material hierarchy

## The Material

1. Suggests a natural process; visibly vulnerable and used
2. Irregular; wrong solutions
3. Unpretentious; Easily co-exist with the rest of the environment
4. Earthy; No craftsmanship
5. Murky; Hard to define
6. Simple; Simple

Wabi-Sabi is not sloppiness. It's not an excuse for messiness and carelessness. Things become Wabi-Sabi through time, not through disregard.

# Programming

(this section is really what still needs *a lot* of work, input and thoughts. I think the links are pretty obvious, but I need to figure them out. With a background on wabi-sabi, I think I can delve quite deep, and hopefully you can give some insights!)

It was not hard to draw links between programming and these aspects.

A program is constantly in flux. It's never complete, and always needs to be rebuilt. You start with nothing, and your program will ultimately be obsolete. If it's non-arbitrary it will have bugs. Even if you think it's bug-free, your compiler has them - you're better off working with this knowledge then against it. Code is about the details, about simplicity, and about doing the right thing. Rather than prettiness, fancy-ness, and pretentiousness. There are many solutions, and there's no "right" way.

And your code gets battered by use. People do things with it you weren't expecting. It's vulnerable. It's fragile. It breaks. It crashes.

It's beautiful and it's ugly. It's simple logic.

What a great way to look at something you build. Appreciate its fragility, respect the logic and the bugs. Work with them, and know that they're part of what you're creating, take them in, and take them on. Don't let them stress you out, and do the best you can to build what you need to build.

True sabi can not be acquired, it is a gift of time.
